### Login

To access the data, you need to provide a secret key and select a file that will be saved or opened (if previously used). If the file has already been registered and data has been entered with a certain secret key, the same key must be used to log in again, as decryption is tested to validate the login.

### Viewing

After successfully logging in, all records are displayed, showing the user and chosen site. There are no specific validations for saving data, only a double password confirmation, so make sure it is correct.

Options to edit, copy (where decryption occurs), or delete a password record are available.
